This is the first neural network I've written, based on neural net from Andrew NG's Machine Learning course on Coursera.
The goal of the project is hadwritten digits recognition.
Feel free to comment. Hope to improve this project soon as I'll learn more complicated programming and machine learning stuff.

Dependencies:
- python3
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib

Usage:

Run NN.py in Python.
