This is first neural network I wrote, based on neural net from Andrew NG's Machine Learning course on Coursera.
The goal of the project is hadwritten digits recognition.
Feel free toconstructively criticize and give me some advices to implement better net.
I'll be using it to learn more skills.
Hope to improve this project soon as I'll learn more compilated programming and machine learning stuff.
